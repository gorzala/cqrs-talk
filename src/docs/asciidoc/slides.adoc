== Motivation

[%step]
 * Spliting up a big monolith
 * Ramification
 * Unable to cope with scalability issues
 * Need to scale read and write parts indiviually
 * Boost time to market
 * Traceability
 * Improve Communication between teams

== Caveats

[%step]
 * Steep Learing Curve
 * Hard to adapt to new way of thinking
 * Thinks people got used to must be rethinked
 * New constraints come up
 ** Eventual consitency (CQRS does not have to be, but in our case it was)
 ** Who own a piece of data
 ** Have to know the business better
 ** Where forced to know understand the responsibilities better

== Benefits

 * Indiviudal scalability
 * Optimized Database Design/Usage

== Basic Idea
foo

[plantuml, rma-use-case-diagram, svg]
....
left to right direction

actor developer
database repo as "central\nrepo"
agent jenkins as "Jenkins"

rectangle admin as "Gerrit / Gitlab" {
    agent ui as "front"
    database repo_local as "local\nrepo"
}

developer --> ui : push
ui --> repo_local : push
ui -left-> jenkins: "\npush "
ui ..> repo : replication
....

== flja

[plantuml, rma-sequence-diagram, svg]
....
participant User
User -> A: DoWork
activate A
A -> B: << createRequest >>
activate B
B -> C: DoWork
activate C
C --> B: WorkDone
destroy C
B --> A: RequestCreated
deactivate B
A -> User: Done
deactivate A
....
